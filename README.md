# Spedran

Spedran (past tense of speedrun) is a simple library to interact with Speedrun.com's REST API.
It uses Optionals for optional members and CompletableFutures for asynchronous retrieval of data.

For readability and brevity, Speedrun.com will be abbreviated as SRC.

Almost entirely limited to only reading data with only a few exceptions related to run moderation/verification.
